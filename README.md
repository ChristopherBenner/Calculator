This is a fully functional 4 function calculator which allows for multiple arguments before hitting enter
Most other simple calculator apps require you to insert the first number followed by the operation
followed by the second number and finally the equals sign. Straying from this format makes the calculator lose functionality
This calculator instead keeps a running total ex inputting 2 + 2 would automatically output 4 if another operation is selected
This way you can keep going without having to hit equals every time. Additionally, there is the option to continue the problem
after selecting enter.
